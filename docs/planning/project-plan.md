# Project Plan: Reddit Startup Idea Generator

## Overview
A web app that fetches real-time posts from Reddit's r/startups subreddit, summarizes them, and helps users discover and act on startup ideas. The app now features AI-powered solution generation, filtering, and a modern, user-friendly interface.

## Features
- **Hot/New Tabs:** Users can switch between trending (hot) and latest (new) startup posts.
- **Confidence Filtering:** Only shows posts with a summarizer confidence score > 45, ensuring relevance.
- **Summarization:** Each post is summarized using a local NLP method for cost-free, fast filtering.
- **AI Solution Generation:** Clicking 'Generate Solution' opens a modal with a step-by-step solution outline, generated by Google Gemini AI based on the post's content.
- **Scrollable Modal:** The solution modal is scrollable for long content and always fits the viewport.
- **Markdown Cleanup:** AI output is cleaned to remove Markdown stars for a clean display.
- **View on Reddit:** Each card links to the original Reddit post.
- **Infinite Scroll for New:** 'Read More' button loads more new posts.
